**IN PROGRESS:  I have this application done for a specific customer.  I am going back through and creating this general version so I can put it here.  Still getting everything up to speed with the already done version.  Once that is done, I know I already need to go back through and refactor a few things.

About:
This application can be used to submit digital works for a contest.  Judging also takes place within the application.  Users can submit works without logging in.  Judges must log in to judge the submissions.  Administrators may also be created and they must log in as well.
